## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the innovative features found on this [site](https://discord.c99.nl).

## Project Overview

The Custom Banner Generator is a versatile tool that combines two distinct yet interconnected components: an API and a bot. These components are organized into two main directories within the project: "api" and "bot". While these two parts can function independently, they share a common configuration through the "package.json" and ".env" files. Though it is possible to use them together, it is generally recommended to use them separately to maintain simplicity and modularity.

**In short, it just generates this little banner, nothing special.**
