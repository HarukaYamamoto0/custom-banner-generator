# custom-banner-generator

### Inspiration:
I was inspired by this [site](https://discord.c99.nl).

### Description:
the project itself is two in one, the two main folders one called "api" and the other "bot", the first one refers to the api files, and the other dis bot files, the two projects are basically independent between itself, the only things the two of them are sharing are the "package.json" files and the ".env" file, you can use them separately or together like I did (which I don't recommend), I think that's it.
